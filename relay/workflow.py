A module for implementing Relay workflows in Python. This is the SDK that
provides a way for your enterprise to extend your I/T tools to your active

    This generally would be used in a third-party system to start a Relay
    workflow via an HTTP trigger and optionally pass data to it with

    for using the https protocol.

    a new access_token will be automatically generated via the refresh_token,
    and the request will be resubmitted with the new access_token. Otherwise
    the refresh token won't be used.

    This method will return a tuple of (requests.Response, access_token)

    if it was updated (otherwise the original access_token will be returned).

    Args:
        access_token(str): the current access token. Can be a placeholder value

        obtain a new access_token. The caller should treat the refresh
        token as very sensitive data, and secure it appropriately.
